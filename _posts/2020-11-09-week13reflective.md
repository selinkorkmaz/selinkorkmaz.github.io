This week I will be discussing my group's progress. Since we do not have anymore required readings, my sole focus is now the project. So let's begin!
<br/>

After my group and I submitted the proposal, we waited on Dr. Pilsch's feedback. A day or two later, we received detailed feedback that was extremely beneficial and transferred it to the Google Doc to keep everything organized. Following this, my group and I scheduled a zoom meeting on 11/9 to review the input and focus on the two issues he presented. The first issue that we faced was our audience analysis and how we will differentiate our site from brazosvotes.org (what can we do better and what can do differently). The second issue is how we need to research responsive design to get our site displayed correctly on a mobile phone and not strictly on a desktop/computer/laptop device. A large majority of 18+ have mobile devices that their eyes are glued on; therefore, we must make sure that our website is displayed correctly. 
<br/>

As our group meeting was coming to an end, we realized that nobody knew where to start. We mean: Do we create a new GitHub account? or do we use one of our accounts instead? We had important questions that only Dr. Pilsch can answer, so our next step was to attend his office hour held on Wednesday mornings. The office hour meeting went super well! He responded to our technical questions about the site and provided us with his knowledge about Brazos Valley voter registration since he is more local than we are. 
<br/>

Another important factor that my group and I need to consider is "How to avoid bias/ do you avoid bias?" We want our site to be neutral and centered around the information to help someone find their specific needs. Our site will not replicate Fox News or CNN, where the public is fully aware that they swing only one party. Fox News is targeting Republicans using conservative ideology, while CNN is targeting Democratic using liberal ideologies. Our website is solely for informational purposes! 
<br/>

Another factor we will possibly incorporate is a FAQ section. As of right now, we have not come up with any FAQ questions to include, so hopefully, after some research, we will have a list. I think a FAQ section with answers that are concise and links to more-depth information is important to provide our users with a more in-depth experience of our website. 
<br/>

Because our audience is on the young adult spectrum, we want our layout and design to capture a contemporary vibe and less of an outdated feel (not hating on other websites, just my opinion). I also want to give a shout out to Kailey for creating a mood board on Pinterest. We can showcase the voting illustrations she found and put it on our site again to help differentiate as they look super cool and artistic. I am very excited about our final product for you all to see!
