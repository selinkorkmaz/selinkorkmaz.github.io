**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heet, commonly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language users can use to make web pages presentable.
<br/> 

By using CSS, users can:
 * Control the color of the text
 * Style of fonts
 * Spacing between paragraphs
 * How columns are sized and laid out
 * What background images or colors are used
 * Layout designs
 * Variations in the display for different devices and screen sizes 
 * And more! 
For this week's activity, I styled my navigation menu to be on the left side right under my title, Let's Unpack This!.  My navigation menu includes headers like Home, About Me, Categories, and Tracery Story. For my categories display, I have activity posts & reflective posts. This helps to sort and group my blog posts into different sections. Categories help visitors quickly know what topics your website is about and allows them to navigate your site faster. 
<br/> 

Let's look at the popular website Amazon for example. When you enter the website, it is automatically set on All (meaning All departments) with a down arrow next to it. Once you click the box All, it will drop down a long, alphabetical list of different categories ranging from Audible Books & Originals to Garden & Outdoor to Video Games and more. I like this feature because when I don't already know what I need to buy, I will browse, and I found the easiest way is by picking a category.

Recently from watching a TikTok, I discovered Amazon Outlet. You click Amazon Warehouse, then Outlet, and bam! 30 more categories to pick from all with great deals. I like Amazon Outlet because you can shop online deals and find low prices on markdowns and overstocks. Totally worth checking out!
