As discussed in my last reflective, Week 14, I mentioned how I took the initiative to make a new repo called final-project and added my group partners as the contributors. Because the final-project repo is a branch of my central GitHub, I discussed with my group that I will take on the role of building/setting up the website's foundation to have the site up and running.
<br/>

I'm sure there is an easier way to duplicate/clone https://selinkorkmaz.github.io/ to https://selinkorkmaz.github.io/final-project/, but I picked to do it old school instead as that is what I am most familiar with. What I mean by that is I followed ALL of Dr. Pilsch's weekly readings & activities to ensure I am not missing any steps for the site to function correctly. 
<br/>

After the foundation was completed, Sarah checked her phone to see how the website will be on a browser. As of right now, we have a small issue where the categories look a little smushed. Accessibility is extremely important for our project because many people are on their phones when they are not on their computer; therefore, we need to make sure that our site works and looks correctly on both devices. 
<br/>

This is more of a minor issue / the perfectionist in me, but I want to figure out / I have been trying to figure it out for the last two days on how to restructure the posts where the first post will go on top, not on the bottom. The only thing I can think of is writing it manually in reverse. For example, I want the title `Important Dates` to be on the top, but it is the very bottom because that was the first post I wrote, so maybe I write it last, and it's fixed. Or my group and I need to code something! 
<br/> 

As I am writing this, Kailey came up with a brilliant idea of changing the headers to the topics. This eliminates the header `Categories` and fixes the blog post order. Having categories can take longer for the user to find specific information; therefore, we will change it where the topics are the headers. There the user can click on it to find direct information. For example, we will create titles like `Absentee Voting` & `Texas ID Voter Laws` instead of underneath Categories. It will now be displayed as its own. And we won't have to worry about the order of the post. Double win!! 
<br/>

A big issue that I solved with the help of Dr. Pilsch- THANK YOU! Was where every time I clicked any of the headers like `Home`, `Categories`, `FAQ`, or `Debate Videos` it would redirect me to my main domain of https://selinkorkmaz.github.io/. I was in the right direction with my original code but was missing a few key elements. I needed to set `hrefs` to the individual files I want to link for it to work (and it did!). Another suggestion by Dr. Pilsch was to create .md (Markdown) instead of HTML to make it easier because any `.md file` can translate into a `.html file` by Jekyll.
