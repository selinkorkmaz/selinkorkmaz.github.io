### A Tale of Crowns
After reading through all the twine games introductions, I picked to play 'A Tale of Crowns' by S.S.G because I found it the most interesting. I saw that they incorporated Kurdish influences, which is crazy because I am half Turkish, and when I went to Turkey- I saw a good amount of Kurds there!
<br/> 

At first, I thought it would be an interactive game with motion pictures and players- kind of like a computer game. But soon realized that it is more of an interactive novel with interactive characters. I enjoyed how detailed and easy to read the description of the story goes. I liked how I was able to choose my path, as well.
<br/>

I am trying to think about what could make 'A Tale of Crowns' like a traditional game because I don't know what the ENGL 460 definition of 'traditional' means since it can be interpreted differently.
<br/>

Because this interactive novel game allows the player to have options to pick from, such as "What do we now?" "Should we go look for father?", "How do they keep finding us?" it reminded me of how in Cards Against Humanity, after the black card is drawn, each player submits a white card from their hand. Their deck consists of options that they need to pick from that will best answer the black card. I would say it is different because the interactive novel game has a continuous storyline.
<br/>

I would say it is like a traditional short story; it is written text with a plot. And as the game progresses, the story goes too. It is different since I can change the outcome, which leads to changing the story's ending.
