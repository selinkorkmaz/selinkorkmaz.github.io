### First Photo
If you know me, then you know that I am a behind the camera, I'll take your photo instead, type of person. I am rarely in front of the camera, but I challenged myself to be in front of it as often as possible because it was my !!!21st BIRTHDAY!!! The image displayed is one of my favorite photos I have ever taken with one of my best friends. We both look so beautiful, so happy, and had the best time! 
<br/>

I have never properly celebrated my birthday ever, as I do not like to be the center of attention. I look at my birthday each year as a regular day, so this time around, I wanted to go all out for my 21st birthday. It was a night to remember, and I miss it!
<br/>

### Second Photo
THE BEST DESSERT EVER! You can't tell me when you look at that photo; your mouth does not water!!
<br/>

I am the friend known to know the best food places in Houston. I have a reputation, and I take loads of pride in it. I LOVE showing my friends with new locations because I love to share my food experience with others. This place is called Sleek Creperies | Cafe, and it is so delicious. If you love chocolate, then this place is where you need to go!! 
<br/>

In high school, my go-to order was a triple chocolate crepe with strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, BUT now I get a triple chocolate waffle with strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Both are amazing, so I highly recommend it! Also, a big tip from me is to bring a water bottle because it helps so much when you are devouring it. 
<br/>

### First Video
Not only am I am pro in basketball, but the video is taken at my friend's house. Her parents wanted to build an indoor basketball court, so whenever we (our friends and I) come over to her place, we like to play basketball. We always have a fun time! 
<br/>

In this video, I told our friend Maria who was recording, that I am making this shot. Keep in mind that this was not my first attempt, but it just so happened that she was recording when I made it in! We both got so excited and kept watching the video over and over again!
<br/>

### Second Video
At first, I tried to find a video that is not of another dessert, but I couldn't resist. Another favorite spot of mine that I love taking people to try is Amorino in River Oaks District. Not only do they have a wide selection of tasty gelato, but when you ask for a cone, they make it into a rose- how cool! I highly recommend this place as I only have great things to say. 
<br/>

### Third Photo
I crave adventure, so when I had the opportunity this past December to go with my friends to New Mexico and make a pit stop at White Sands National Park, I was so excited! They have so many dunes, the sky was beautiful, and the sand is exceptionally soft. 
<br/>

The funny part about this photo is after I took it, one of our friends told us how they lost their AirPods. To go into more detail, when I was taking pictures, some of my friends wanted to roll down the sand for fun, and one of them had his AirPods in his jean pocket, and next thing you know, it was gone. Poof! We all spent about twenty minutes trying to find it but no luck since white blends with white. 
<br/>

### Fourth Photo
I have this weird thing of asking my friends to send me any nature photos they take to use it as my lock and home screen. I love nature and being outdoors. I think everyone appreciates nature differently, and I love being able to see a glimpse of what they see via a photo. Every time, I look at the picture, it brings me a big smile :) 
<br/>

Please send me photos!
