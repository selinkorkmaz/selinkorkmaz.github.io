### First Photo
If you know me, then you know that I am a behind the camera, I'll take your photo instead, type of person. I am rarely in front of the camera, but I challenged myself to be in front of it as often as possible because it was my !!!21st BIRTHDAY!!! The image displayed is one of my favorite photos I have ever taken with one of my best friends. We both look so beautiful, so happy, and had the best time! 
<br/>

I have never properly celebrated my birthday ever, as I do not like to be the center of attention. I look at my birthday each year as a regular day, so this time around, I wanted to go all out for my 21st birthday. It was a night to remember, and I miss it!

I am the friend known to know the best food places in Houston. I have a reputation, and I take loads of pride in it. I LOVE showing my friends with new locations because I love to share my food experience with others. This place is called Sleek Creperies | Cafe, and it is so delicious. If you love chocolate, then this place is where you need to go!!

In high school, my go-to order was a triple chocolate crepe with strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, BUT now I get a triple chocolate waffle with strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Both are amazing, so I highly recommend it! Also, a big tip from me is to bring a water bottle because it helps so much when you are devouring it.
