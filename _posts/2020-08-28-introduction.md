title: Hello! 
---

---
  My name is Selin Korkmaz and I am half Taiwanese/ half Turkish.
  I am a senior Communication major with a double minor in Chinese and Cybersecurity from Houston, TX. 
  I have an unhealthy obsession with collecting thrifted Christmas sweaters- they bring me so much joy :) 
  You can catch me always at the movies, trying new food places, being outdoors, or taking lots of photos. 
  My favorite food of all time is sushi specifically from Aka Sushi House in HTX- seriously so good!!

My whole life, writing has been my biggest weakness. And on top of that, since I was in elementary 
school, I have been teased on my grammar and pronoucation. This resulted in me being insecure with 
how I speak and write.

---
---
I am taking this course not only to challenge myself but also because I have an interest in "digital"
writing and after my internship this past summer, I know that my future is based on writing.

---
---
The only way to be good at writing is with lots and lots of practice!
