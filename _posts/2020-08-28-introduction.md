  My whole life, writing has been my biggest weakness. And on top of that, since I was in elementary 
  school, I have been teased on my grammar and pronoucation. This resulted in me being insecure with 
  how I speak and write.

<div class="text-red mb-2">
  I am taking this course not only to challenge myself but also because I have an interest in "digital"
  writing and after my internship this past summer, I know that my future is based on writing.

The only way to be good at writing is with lots and lots of practice!
