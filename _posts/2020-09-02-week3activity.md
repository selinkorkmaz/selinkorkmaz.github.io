title: What is Data?
---

This week's topic was about data. When I clicked the link to see the data visualization category, instantly there was a ton of different kinds of visualization that I was unfamiliar with but excited to learn more about.

## Word Cloud

During my senior year of high school, I was in a school program called PALS (Peer Assistance and Leadership). At our PALS banquet, the teacher gifted each of us a present. It was a framed word cloud of all the characteristics that everyone wrote down about each other. Not only did it make everyone feel loved, but it was also a thoughtful gift to keep for years and years. I have held mine in my room hung on the wall ever since, and every time I look at it, I am reminded that I am funny, kind, honest, fair, and more.

## Team Members Cards

The Card Picker is a dictionary compound data that uses several keys linked to a specific scalar data. Meaning, each team member's name is scalar data linked to four keys: phone number, location, job role, and photo. The phone number is a number scalar, location, and job role are text scalar, and the image is a blob.

I like the simple, sharp, and easy to read format of the card picker, but I am not a fan of the color combination. The green, purple, and orange next to each other are not it! But I do love how quick it shows the rest of the card when you click on it.

Right now, the card picker showcases four cards with four different job titles. If they were about 20+ cards, I would either alphabetize by name or job description to make it easier. If a larger company with 5+ departments wanted to create this, even using the colors for categorization is a great option. For example, blue = types of engineers, red = human resources, green = business, etc. to help keep it organized.
