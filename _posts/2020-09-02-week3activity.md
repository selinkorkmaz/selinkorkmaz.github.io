## Word Cloud

My senior year of high school , I was in a program called PALS (Peer Assistance and Leadership) and my teacher gave each of us a lovely present at our PALS banquet. It was a framed word cloud of all the characteristics that everyone wrote down about each other. It made everyone feel loved and it was a thoughtful gift to keep for years and years.
