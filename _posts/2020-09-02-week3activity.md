title: What is Data?
---

This week's topic was about data. When I clicked the link to see the data visualization category, instantly there was a ton of different kinds of visualization that I was unfamiliar with but excited to learn more about.

## Word Cloud

During my senior year of high school, I was in a school program called PALS (Peer Assistance and Leadership). At our PALS banquet, the teacher gifted each of us a present. It was a framed word cloud of all the characteristics that everyone wrote down about each other. Not only did it make everyone feel loved, but it was also a thoughtful gift to keep for years and years. I have held mine in my room hung on the wall ever since, and every time I look at it, I am reminded that I am funny, kind, honest, fair, and more.
