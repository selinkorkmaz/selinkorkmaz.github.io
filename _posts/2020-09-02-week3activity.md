title: What is Data?
---

This week's topic was about data. When I clicked the link to see the data visualization category, instantly there was a ton of different kinds of visualization that I was unfamiliar with but excited to learn more about. 
<br/>

## Word Cloud

During my senior year of high school, I was in a school program called PALS (Peer Assistance and Leadership). At our PALS banquet, the teacher gifted each of us a present. It was a framed word cloud of all the characteristics that everyone wrote down about each other. Not only did it make everyone feel loved, but it was also a thoughtful gift to keep for years and years. I have held mine in my room hung on the wall ever since, and every time I look at it, I am reminded that I am funny, kind, honest, fair, and more.

## Team Members Cards

The Card Picker is a dictionary compound data that uses several keys linked to a specific scalar data. Meaning, each team member's name is scalar data linked to four keys: phone number, location, job role, and photo. The phone number is a number scalar, location, and job role are text scalar, and the image is a blob.
<br/>

I like the simple, sharp, and easy to read format of the card picker, but I am not a fan of the color combination. The green, purple, and orange next to each other are not it! But I do love how quick it shows the rest of the card when you click on it.
<br/>
 
Right now, the card picker showcases four cards with four different job titles. If they were about 20+ cards, I would either alphabetize by name or job description to make it easier. If a larger company with 5+ departments wanted to create this, even using the colors for categorization is a great option. For example, blue = types of engineers, red = human resources, green = business, etc. to help keep it organized.

## The Demographics of Others

The Demographics of Others visualization used an interactive square pie chart to collect sex, age group, and race or origin from the 2016 American Community Survey. Once a user clicks their sex, age group, and race or origin, it will further break down the information into fourteen different categories.
<br/>

As someone who identifies as mixed race (half Turkish/half Taiwanese), I would not be able to click and find where I fit in the picture, so that is a huge disadvantage. I would like to see an option with two or more races, so people like myself can analyze the data and feel included.
<br/>

I like how the creator incorporated different colors for each graph, giving it a distinguish. I like how when you click the other options, the graph instantly switches. The interactive square pie chart visually looks appealing to the user's eye, but it can be hard to read for some. The more the square chart is filled, the more challenging; in my opinion, it is to read what exactly the percentage is without having to count the squares. I don't know if incorporating somewhere the percentage alongside the square pie chart defeats the whole purpose of this specific type of chart, but that could be helpful.
<br/>

## Based on a True Story

At first glance, the visualization is very chaotic. If someone was unfamiliar or had not heard of this type of chart, they might feel the same. The data is presented to show which parts of each movie are true and how true are they to reality. As someone who is a HUGE movie lover, I love this and will be spending lots of time on it.
<br/>

The data incorporates a Likert scale from True, True-ish, False-ish, False, Unknown along with different colors. I also like how it provides a credible source under reality for proof. I think it is really cool to see how much accuracy (percentage and visually by colors) is based on a true story movie. The movie Selma has 100%, while The Imitation Game has 42.3%.
<br/>

Overall, the visualization is very straightforward with in-depth research. It provides a timestamp, a clear image of the movie's part, detail of the movie scene, a realistic description, and whether it is one of the five options. I want more movies to be added!!
