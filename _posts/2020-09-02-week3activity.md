title: What is Data?
---

This week's topic was about data. When I clicked the link to see the data visualization category, instantly there was a ton of different kinds of visualization that I was unfamiliar with but excited to learn more about. 
<br/>

## Gannt Chart

To be fair, I clicked on this visualization because the name caught my eye. As soon as I saw the visual, I immediately thought, "Wait a minute, this reminds me of a planner but in a different set up."

According to the website, Gantt Charts display a list of activities (or tasks) with their duration over time, showing when each activity starts and ends. This makes Gantt Charts useful for planning and estimating how long an entire project might take. You can also see what activities are running parallel to each other.

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">

        <img src="/gchart2.png" width="350" length="250">

## Word Cloud

During my senior year of high school, I was in a school program called PALS (Peer Assistance and Leadership). At our PALS banquet, the teacher gifted each of us a present. It was a framed word cloud of all the characteristics that everyone wrote down about each other. Not only did it make everyone feel loved, but it was also a thoughtful gift to keep for years and years. I have held mine in my room hung on the wall ever since, and every time I look at it, I am reminded that I am funny, kind, honest, fair, and more.
