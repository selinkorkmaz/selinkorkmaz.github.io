After 11 weeks, we have finally completed reading, writing, and reflecting on the materials taught by Dr. Pisch. Now we began the final project by either working independently or forming a group with either one or two people. I took it upon myself to find two others to collaborate with on the project. With that being said, I am happy to present Kailey Maclin and Sarah Do! They are great communicators and group partners, and I feel lucky to have them because I have struggled with group projects before in college, but they make it easy.
<br/>

On October 14, we had a zoom call to brainstorm ideas, and then we narrowed it down to a winner. I suggested we create a website focused on voter registration for Texas A&M University students  since it is an election year. Even though the election results are finalized long before our website is completed and running- it doesn't hurt to create one still! Kailey made a Google Doc for our group where she added all the requirements and due dates, so everything was easier for us to see/find.  We also started our group proposal inside Google Docs as well, so everyone can see and edit it simultaneously. 
<br/>

Now let's talk about the proposal! Dr. Pilsch provided a proposal guideline to follow that covered everything we needed to answer. I also sent him a direct message on behalf of my group asking for more details (if anything was missing from the provided guideline) and for more direction on how to go about it. From there, we copied and pasted the guideline and Dr. Pilsch added information into our Google Doc, where we began to answer each question one by one. Our group picked to answer the questions in bullet form instead of your traditional paragraph, which I believe is a lot easier on the reader. 
<br/>

For our project, we will create a website with an easy to navigate, user-friendly website with information about polling station locations, ballot drop box locations, post office locations, what to bring, how to register, absentee ballot information, and more. The main goal of our site is to inform the Texas A&M student body about the importance of voting and how to do it. We are aware that tons of websites on Google provide the same information, but we will make ours different and better by keeping it simple and adding a touch of graphics for character. Because who doesn't like graphic designs as an added element!! 
<br/>

I am passionate about voter registration and excited to create a website with my group to share with fellow students for easy access. There was a large voting turnout this election, but I still believe there are people out there with little to no knowledge, and I would love to share this website with all the information one would need. I know people rather spend their time browsing Instagram, scrolling through TikTok, or finishing up a Netflix episode instead of researching candidates or information over voter registration. Still, the election is important, and your vote COUNTS. So be on the lookout!
