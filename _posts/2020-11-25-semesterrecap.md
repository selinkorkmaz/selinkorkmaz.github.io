You might be wondering, "Selin, did you forget to do your semester recap??" and the answer is, "of course notttt!" 
<br/>

As you know, after 11 weeks (we are entering week 15 as I write this post), the class will have completed all the reading, writing, and reflecting on the materials taught by Dr. Pisch. Now we began the final project of producing an artifact utilizing the skills we have developed this semester. 
<br/>

Some examples include:
* Forming a blog
* Creating a site for an organization
* Making hypertext
* Developing a bot of some sort

Regarding my group with two excellent partners Kailey and Sarah, we are focus on creating a platform dedicated to voting registration. Our website will cover topics about `Voting in COVID`, `Important dates to remember`, `The importance of voting`, `Where do you start`, `What are your voting rights`, `Texas Voter ID laws`, `Absentee voting`, and `more`!!
