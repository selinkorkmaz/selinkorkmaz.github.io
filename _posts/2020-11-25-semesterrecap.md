You might be wondering, "Selin, did you forget to do your semester recap??" and the answer is, "of course notttt!" 
<br/>

As you know, after 11 weeks (we are entering week 15 as I write this post), the class will have completed all the reading, writing, and reflecting on the materials taught by Dr. Pisch. Now we began the final project of producing an artifact utilizing the skills we have developed this semester. 
<br/>

Some examples include:
* Forming a blog
* Creating a site for an organization
* Making hypertext
* Developing a bot of some sort

Regarding my group with two excellent partners Kailey and Sarah, we are focus on creating a platform dedicated to **voting registration**. Our website will cover topics about `Voting in COVID`, `Important dates to remember`, `The importance of voting`, `Where do you start`, `What are your voting rights`, `Texas Voter ID laws`, `Absentee voting`, and `more`!!
<br/>

I observed classmate [Murphy Scott's website](https://murphyscott.github.io/) and read her most [recent post](https://murphyscott.github.io/reflections/2020/11/06/reflection-10.html), which described how she wants to create a website that will incorporate the following:
* Help people in some sort of way
* Have them learn something
* Have one good chuckle before leaving my site 

After further reading, it turns out her website will be about **election aid**, which I would say is similar/underneath the same category as my groups. Her focus is more directed to the overall election topic, where she will cover the `correct information about the election`, `the historical context`, `policies`, `candidates`, etc. At the same time, my group focuses on stressing why it is important to vote, how your vote matters, how to vote, etc. All in all, we could combine our sites where it would be very informative and easy to use for students/anyone undereducated to use, love, and share.
