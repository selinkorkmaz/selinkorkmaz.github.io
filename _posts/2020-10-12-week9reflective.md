The World Wide Web equals the combination of computer networking (the Internet) and **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkUp **L**anguage (HTML) into an easy, user-friendly system where users can access information from around the world from a computer. Hypertext is the medium used to transmit the information in a non-linear fashion by clicking on the computer link using your mouse. These links provide readers the option to "jump" to further information about a specific topic being discussed.

Three examples on how to incorporate hypertext links: 
1. Using hyperlinks in an email 
	* The writer can create an email to send, which can include different hyperlinks. Let's say the creator wanted to have five kinds of hyperlinks. Two of them are videos, one is a news article, one is a blog post, and the last one is a presentation.
2. Using images as buttons for hyperlinks 
	* I am sure plenty of us have seen a clickable image/button on a website that we cannot resist clicking. This technique is an effective call-to-action button and provides a different style of presentation. 
3. Hyperlinked video
	* Adding a hyperlink to the video's image added to the landing page (typically a home page) allows the user not to open a new browser window but instead play the video in the frame directly on the site. This technique keeps the user focused on the page and the video's message.
