In my sophomore year of college, I took CSCE 111 with Robert Lightfoot, and one of our assignments was to create a personal website using HTML. As I do remember creating the website and having a ton of fun; unfortunately, I cannot find the website anymore as I believe it is no longer active since I had to use people.tamu.edu.
<br/>
 
People.tamu.edu allows authorized Texas A&M users to publish a personal web page. A webpage is simply a text file written special tags called HTML.
<br/>

Luckily, I do remember the web page Professor Lightfoot created for his Spring 2019 CSCE 111 course that I took. After locating the website, I right-clicked on the page for the menu option to display "View Page Source." After clicking on it, it opens the document source, showing the page's HTML.
<br/>

As I examine Professor Lightfoot's website, he does incorporate a heading. HTML headings are titles or subtitles you want to display on the webpage ranging from <h1> to <h6>. <h1> defines the most important heading and <h6> defines the least important heading.
