When you are designing a website, there are many things to consider: 
1. What do you want the website to do? 
2. What should it look like? 
3. How will you drive the right people to the site? 
4. **Who are you targeting with the new site?**

When the web creator(s) know their audience, it will help them identify the key features needed for the website. It is important to include all the things the target audience wants to do on our site. For example, my group and I (spoiler alert!!) are creating a website focused on informing our audience (Texas A&M students) about all things voting.

Next is the design of the website. We need to identify the audience we are designing to to help us figure out the best way to approach our site's look and feel. Because my group and I are catering to Texas A&M students, we will collectively figure out how to incorporate the right photos, colors, font size and styles, and layouts. We will make sure to tailor the design of our site to the appeal of our target audience. So definitely a touch of maroon! Even though my group and I want our website to be visually appealing, we cannot take away the important content. We will provide informative content that is easy and clear to find to educate our target audience about voting.
