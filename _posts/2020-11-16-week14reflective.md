Another week of a group project reflection. Let's do it!! 
<br/>

This week, my two group members had multiple projects for other classes to finish, so I took the initiative to make a new repo called `final-project` for us. At first, I added my members as contributors to my repo. I shortly realized that that wouldn't make sense because my repo is a website answering all the homework assignments, and my group project needs a whole separate platform using GitHub, which can't combine with mine. I asked Dr. Pilsch for assistance. He happily assisted by telling me to create a new repo and do the project there because each repo can have Github pages configured and can be a separate website then add my contributors. So that is how the new repo final-project was created. 
<br/>

December 8th is only two weeks and three days away, which means CHOP CHOP. I think my group and I's next meeting will discuss how we want to divide and conquer the website. I will be suggesting we talk about the titles of each section we want to have, i.e., important dates, where do you start, Texas voter ID laws, absentee voting, additional resources, FAQ, and more. 
<br/>

After finalizing the titles, we can then proceed on who wants to write which one and set a due date (maybe a week before December 8th).  Lastly, after completing the writing portion, we can start the fun stuff of adding pictures & videos and changing colors & fonts, essentially the formatting and styling.

I am excited to officially start the project's content as I am passionate about the topic of voting. I know voting/talking about your political beliefs can be a sensitive subject for people and can lead to aggressive argumental debates. Still, I firmly believe if you are a citizen of the United States, it is your responsibility to go out and vote. But before you cast your ballot, you must take the time to research and education yourself on the candidates. And before you research, REGISTRAR!!
