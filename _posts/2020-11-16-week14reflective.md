Another week of a group project reflection. Let's do it!! 
<br/>

This week, my two group members had multiple projects for other classes to finish, so I took the initiative to make a new repo called `final-project` for us. At first, I added my members as contributors to my repo. I shortly realized that that wouldn't make sense because my repo is a website answering all the homework assignments, and my group project needs a whole separate platform using GitHub, which can't combine with mine. I asked Dr. Pilsch for assistance. He happily assisted by telling me to create a new repo and do the project there because each repo can have Github pages configured and can be a separate website then add my contributors. So that is how the new repo final-project was created. 
<br/>

December 8th is only two weeks and three days away, which means CHOP CHOP. I think my group and I's next meeting will discuss how we want to divide and conquer the website. I will be suggesting we talk about the titles of each section we want to have, i.e., important dates, where do you start, Texas voter ID laws, absentee voting, additional resources, FAQ, and more. 
<br/>

After finalizing the titles, we can then proceed on who wants to write which one and set a due date (maybe a week before December 8th).  Lastly, after completing the writing portion, we can start the fun stuff of adding pictures & videos and changing colors & fonts, essentially the formatting and styling.

I am excited to officially start the project's content as I am passionate about the topic of voting. I know voting/talking about your political beliefs can be a sensitive subject for people and can lead to aggressive argumental debates. Still, I firmly believe if you are a citizen of the United States, it is your responsibility to go out and vote. But before you cast your ballot, you must take the time to research and education yourself on the candidates. And before you research, REGISTRAR!! 
<br/>

Once upon a time, I was a freshman political science major involved in an on-campus organization called Municipal Affairs whose mission was to get students out to vote. We all had to be a Texas volunteer deputy registrar first before we could reach out to students. We had the goal to register at least 500 new student voters for the 2017 City Council election. Then, we planned to mobilize our registered student voters on Election Day to ensure their participation in our democratic process at the local level. 
<br/>

Not going to lie; it was challenging to get people to register to vote. My team and I would take shifts at the Memorial Student Center, attempting to approach the students walking back and forth to come to our table. The times we failed, we would ask them a simple question of "are you registered to vote?" and depending on their response determines our next course of action. An idea I had was to partner with Texas A&M Panhellenic to create a Panhellenic point so that every sorority girl had the opportunity to earn an easy point simply by registering to vote with us and it worked.
