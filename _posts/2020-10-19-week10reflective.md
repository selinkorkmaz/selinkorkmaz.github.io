According to Dr. Pilsch, aleatory poetry is the process of using chance to generate text. For example, a poet can take an existing piece of their writing and submit it to chance operations (a method of generating poetry independent of the author's will). This can be done by deleting every third word, cutting up the text and putting the pieces together in a random sequence, or what I did change certain words and replace them with synonyms.

After coming up with a random story, I thought it would be easier to change certain words and replace them with synonyms. Here is what I did: 
* **Thomas**: Tom & Tommy
* **Cleverer**: more intelligent, brighter, smarter, gifted, talented 
* **Little**: small, mini, tiny
* **Creatures**: critters & living things 
* **Kill: murder**, assassinate, destroy, eliminate 
* **Sitting**: stationed & seated 
* **Sweetmeats**: sweets & enjoyments 
* **Death**: end, demise, passing, expiration
