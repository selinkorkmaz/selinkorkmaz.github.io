# Mr. Rebates


The real-world example I will be discussing is the website Mr. Rebates on https://www.mrrebates.com/. The website is a shopping portal where you can do online shopping and earn cash back from shopping at 3000+ stores.\

As you enter the website, you are initially presented with five store names on the left, the store of the week (as I am writing this it is shop Disney), and an eBay coupon. As you scroll just a tad bit, you will see the Weekly Deals, which displays twenty-eight different stores. Lastly, right below the Weekly Deals list is the New Stores, which includes six more different stores.
 
On Weekly Deals, each key in its dictionary is staggered. The keys we see are store name (text scalar), cash back percentage (number scalar), and store deals (text scalar).

If you click the tab Stores, it brings you to All Stores to find the store you are looking for from A-Z. On this page, each key in its dictionary is lined up horizontally. The keys we see are store name (text scalar), coupons (number scalar), and cash back (number scalar).
 
Let's say I am shopping online at Forever 21, and I found a minimum of one item to put in my shopping cart for purchase. Before I complete my purchase, I remember that I need to check Mr. Rebates for cash back. I have three ways of finding Forever 21's cash back. First, I can type it in the search bar. Second, I can click Stores -> All Store -> letter F and scroll down to Forever 21. Third, I can click Stores -> Apparel & Accessories and scroll down to Forever 21. Whichever method will tell me that Forever 21 is doing 3% cash back and has one coupon available.
