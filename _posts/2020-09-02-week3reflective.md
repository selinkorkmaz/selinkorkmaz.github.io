## Mr. Rebates

The real-world example I will be discussing is the website Mr. Rebates onÂ https://www.mrrebates.com/. The website is a shopping portal where you can do online shopping and earn cash back from shopping at 3000+ stores.
<br/>

As you enter the website, you are initially presented with five store names on the left, the store of the week (as I am writing this it is shop Disney), and an eBay coupon. As you scroll just a tad bit, you will see the Weekly Deals, which displays twenty-eight different stores. Lastly, right below the Weekly Deals list is the New Stores, which includes six more different stores.
<br/>

On Weekly Deals, each key in its dictionary is staggered. The keys we see are store name (text scalar), cash back percentage (number scalar), and store deals (text scalar).

When you click the tab Stores, it brings you to the page of All Stores where you can find a number of stores from A-Z. On this page, each key in its dictionary is lined up horizontally. The keys we see are store name (text scalar), coupons (number scalar), and cash back (number scalar).

Let's say I am shopping online at Forever 21, and I found a minimum of one item to put in my shopping cart for purchase. Before I complete my purchase, I remember that I need to check Mr. Rebates for cash back. I have three ways of finding Forever 21's cash back. First, I can type it in the search bar. Second, I can click Stores -> All Store -> letter F and scroll down to Forever 21. Third, I can click Stores -> Apparel & Accessories and scroll down to Forever 21. All three methods will tell me that Forever 21 is doing 3% cash back and has one coupon available.

I like how there are different ways to navigate through the website, making it user friendly. The search bar is the quickest way by far, and it is what I use personally. The All Stores button showcases the wide variety the website has. Lastly, I like how the website incorporates categories; for example, Home & Garden has Kirkland's and Travel & Luggage has CityPASS. Categorization is a helpful tool because it groups similar stores.

Overall, Mr. Rebates is a simple, user-friendly website for users to navigate through. This website displays a list of its dictionary for users to chose from. It has so many stores you probably never heard of, which is excellent because it will increase your chance of a store that you are looking for is there.

Let's not forget- who doesn't love cash back!!  Depending on which store, Mr. Rebates goes as low as 0.5% cash back up to 30% cash back. So sign up today!
