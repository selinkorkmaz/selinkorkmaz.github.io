Metadata means data about data. It describes data containing specific information like type, length, textual description, and other characteristics. 
<br/>

### Types of Metadata
1. `Descriptive` - extracts information from the item (title & author) and assign terms (subject headings & classification) for discovery and selection 
2. `Structural` - shows how information is put together like a table of contents 
3. `Administrative` - provides information to help manage a resource such as when and how it was created, file type, other technical information, and who can access it 
<br/>

### Why is Metadata important?
It generates the ability to find the right files using associated keywords, understand the content, use files correctly, manage assets more efficiently, and re-arrange assets by specific criteria i.e., last modification date. 
<br/>

### Where do we use Metadata? 
Metadata is used in so many things! Used in search engines, used to find a friend on Facebook, used to look up videos on YouTube, used to look for a recipe in a cookbook, used to search for an article on a database, and more.

### Digital Image
Each time you take a photo, a bunch of metadata is gathered and saved. The metadata includes name, title, type, owner, description, tags, time and data, color depth, resolution, date of creation, and location attached. 

The size of the image can include side dimensions and units of measurement. The color aspect may also be depicted which can entail contrast, colors used, and the extent of the colors. Metadata also specifies the resolution of the image.

### Text Document 
Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or any other type of word processor software will collect some standard metadata and enable you to add your own fields for each document. Typical fields are title, subject, author, company, status, creation date and time, characters, words, paragraphs, and page numbers.
