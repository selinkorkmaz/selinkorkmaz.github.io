Metadata is data that describes data containing specific information like type, length, textual description, and other characteristics.
<br/>

There are three main types of metadata: 
1. `Descriptive` - used for discovering and identifying assets, for example, includes elements like title, abstract, author, and relevant keywords 
2. `Structural` - indicates how a digital asset is organized, for example, how pages in a book are organized to form chapters
3. `Administrative` - relates to the technical source of a digital asset, for example, the file type and how the asset was created
