Metadata is data that describes data containing specific information like type, length, textual description, and other characteristics.
<br/>

There are three main types of metadata: 
1. `Descriptive` - used for discovering and identifying assets, for example, includes elements like title, abstract, author, and relevant keywords 
2. `Structural` - indicates how a digital asset is organized, for example, how pages in a book are organized to form chapters
3. `Administrative` - relates to the technical source of a digital asset, for example, the file type and how the asset was created 

For our Hands-on Activity this week, Dr. Pilsch instructed us to add a list of categories to our blog post, install a category page, then add it to our website menu helping our users navigate our site. Adding a category page is extremely useful for keeping a website organized and assisting users in navigating quickly by narrowing down the options and guiding them to their desired topic. In terms of the class, I picked adding two categories - reflective post & activity post.

After researching more about metadata, I found in digital images, when you take a photo, a bunch of metadata will be gathered and saved. Types of metadata elements include name, title, type, owner, descriptions, tags, time, date, color depth, resolution, and location. More specifically, the size of the image can include side dimensions and units of measurement. Metadata can also specify the resolution of the picture.

Text documents like Microsoft Word & Google Docs will collect some standard metadata and enable you to add your fields for each document. Typical areas are title, subject, author, company, status, creation date and time, characters, words, paragraphs, and page numbers.
