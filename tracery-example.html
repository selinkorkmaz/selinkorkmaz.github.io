  "origin": "Once upon a time there was a brave boy called Robert Jones. He was on the way to see his sister Faith jones, when he decided to take a short cut through the forest.<br><br>It wasnâ€™t long before Robert got lost. He looked around, but all he could see were trees. Nervously, he felt into his bag for his fidget spinner but was no where to be found! Robert began to panic. He felt sure he had it packed. To make matters worse, he was starting to feel hungry.<br><br>Unexpectedly, he saw a brown bear dressed in a pair of jeans disappearing into the trees.<br><br>'How odd! 'thought Robert.<br><br>For the want of anything better to do, he decided to follow the peculiarly dressed bear. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest. <br><br>Eventually, Robert reached a clearing. He found himself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from carrots, a house made from biscuits, a house made from chips, and a house made from oreos. <br><br>Robert could feel his tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease his hunger.<br><br>'Hello!'he called.'Is anybody there?'<br><br>Nobody replied.#middle#",
